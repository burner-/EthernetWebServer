# EthernetWebServer
This is Arduino Web server. Library based to Ivan Grokhotkov's ESP8266WebServer. It is modified to work with Arduino. 
To compile this lib you need add functional-vlpp and StandardCplusplus library as reference. Also you may or may not need add -std=c++11 to compiler flags at platform.txt

All filesystem features are commented out. Library works but it is still work in progress. If you fix or add something, pleas make pull request ;)
